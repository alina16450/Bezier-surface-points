This is a short program I wrote independently to help assist with a course related to calculations of Bézier curves and surfaces. It demonstrates an implementation of De Casteljau’s algorithm for evaluating points
on a Bézier surface, a fundamental concept in computer graphics and CAD systems.The code is designed to read control point data from a file, apply the algorithm in two dimensions, and compute a precise surface point based on user-defined 
parameters. It's a great blend of mathematical theory and practical programming!
